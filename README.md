# CR-MMnet
CR-MMNet is an innovative AI model specifically designed for flexible electronics, with the core mission of rapidly and accurately predicting the maximum stress and maximum strain of complex-structured flexible interconnecting wires (FIWs) under load. By employing a novel architecture based on multi-modal input and multi-task learning, the model effectively overcomes the bottlenecks of traditional Finite Element Analysis (FEA), which is time-consuming and computationally intensive. It skillfully integrates the physical principles of FEA with real-world experimental data, enabling rapid inference in the order of milliseconds to seconds while ensuring highly reliable predictions. In practical validation, the model's predictions showed strong agreement with simulation results and were successfully applied to agricultural scenarios such as strawberry leaf temperature sensors and tomato leaf temperature sensors, with minimal error between predicted and measured values. This method provides an efficient solution for designing highly reliable, growth-adaptive flexible sensors in dynamic agricultural environments, significantly accelerating the design optimization process.
